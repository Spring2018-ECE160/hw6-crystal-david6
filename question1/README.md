## Question 1

Write a funciton that determines the maximum and minimum values from a one-dimensional array. Assume that the corresponding function prototype statement is

<code>void ranges(int x[], int npts, int *max_ptr, int *min_ptr)</code>

where npts contain the number of values in array x, and max_ptr and min_ptr are pointers to the variables in which to store the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Provide and print out 3 examples to show that your function is working as intended.

Compile Steps:
Example1: a[5]={4, 3, 4, 2, 5}
Example2: a[5]={7, 3, 4, 12, 5}
Example3: a[5]={6, 7, 4, 2, 5, 9} 

Output:
Example1: maximum: 5 minimum: 2
Example2: maximum: 12 minimum: 3
Example3: maximum: 9 minimum: 2
